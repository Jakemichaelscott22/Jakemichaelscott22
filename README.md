## Hi there 👋

**Jakemichaelscott22/Jakemichaelscott22** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

## 📌 Background
I hold both **CompTIA A+** and **CompTIA Security+** certifications, with:
- **6 months of IT experience** focused on **software and hardware troubleshooting and repairs**, including diagnosing system issues and replacing system components.  
- **1 year of cybersecurity experience** specializing in **penetration testing** and **vulnerability management**

My cybersecurity work has centered on:
- Conducting **penetration tests** to identify weaknesses in infrastructure  
- Applying the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to map adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)  
- Using **NIST SP 800‑30** to perform risk assessments and recommend mitigations for identified vulnerabilities

## 🎯 Objective
This GitHub repository is my **hands-on learning portfolio**.  
I am using it to:
- Document and showcase **cybersecurity projects** that demonstrate practical skills  
- Explore both **Red Team** and **Blue Team** approaches
